# PennLabs iOS Challenge
Fall 2018 PennApps iOS Challenge

## Inspiration
This is a clone of the Dining portion of the Penn Mobile App. Creating a clone was part of the challenge proposed by PennLabs as part of the application process.

## Additional Features
- Dependency Free
- Pull to refresh
- Progress Bar in WebView

## Going Forward
- I would have loved to have given SiriKit a shot, but I didn't have quite enough time. I hope to possible integrate SiriKit with this or on a future project.

# PennLabs iOS Challenge
Fall 2018 PennApps iOS Challenge

## Inspiration
This is a clone of the Dining portion of the Penn Mobile App. Creating a clone was part of the challenge proposed by PennLabs as part of the application process. I also wanted to extend the functionality of the app and sprinkled in a few add ins.

## Additional Features
- Check if internet is down and WebView blockling if it is
- In app errors and notifications (Courtesy of NotificationBanner: https://github.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner)
- Pull to refresh
- Progress Bar in WebView

## Going Forward
- I would have loved to have given SiriKit a shot, but I didn't actually have a Apple Developer Account at the moment. I hope to possible integrate SiriKit with this or on a future project.
